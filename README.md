# Food-Finder
An app that takes user input such as a food item, and then gives the user options for take out or online recipes as well as recommendations for those food items and local stores.
We were able to create our application using dynamically updated HTML, CSS and Javascript and Jquery!
Our "Food Finder" application allows users to browse their favorite food recipies and find nearby restaurants in their local area with their favorite food selections!
Using the recipie API embedded in our Javascript, users can search the recipie for their favorite foods! Users can also search nearby restaurants serving their specific food selections using the Google Maps API also within our Javascript code!
Our application is appealing to the eye, and very accesible for all ages! 
It's so easy, even a child could find their favorite food place near them!
