# Food-Finder
An app that takes user input such as a food item, and then gives the user various options for online recipes as well as recommendations for nearby grocery stores.

We were able to create our application using dynamically updated HTML, CSS and Javascript and Jquery!
Our "Food Finder" application allows users to browse their favorite food recipies and find nearby restaurants in their local area with their favorite food selections!
